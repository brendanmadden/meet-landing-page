## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge tested me on a few different levels. Although the current product isn't pixel perfect, I'm proud that I was able to plan and code this project in about 7 hours, in one day. I continued to learn flexbox and setting up a layout in CSS. I also continued to learn and practice responsive desgin and media queries. 

### Continued development

I have a number of area's I would like to continue to develop and improve in. The most important area's for improvement I would like to focus on are my responsive design, accessibility, and layout capabilities. I need to get better with media queries and ensuring the product works on every device, at every screen size.
